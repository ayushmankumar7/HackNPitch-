# HackNPitch Summit

This project includes a traffic simulation aimed at making the traffic flow smoother across traffic lights, while also taking into account the convenience of pedestrians.

## Features

- [x] Smart Traffic Light management so that a car does not have to stop at successive traffic lights if they travel with the recommended speed.
- [x] Using object detection to automatically stop cars to allow pedestrians to cross if the number of pedestrians wanting to cross exceeds a certain threshold.
- [x] Using ultrasonic sensors to detect absence of cars along the road and allowing pedestrians to cross till a car arrives.
- [x] An app based dashboard for overriding the signals remotely and setting up timers.
